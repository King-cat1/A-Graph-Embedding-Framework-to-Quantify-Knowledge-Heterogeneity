# A-Graph-Embedding-Framework-to-Quantify-Knowledge-Heterogeneity
Abstract
Interdisciplinary research (IDR) increasingly drives scientific progress, yet the precise role of knowledge source heterogeneity remains debated. Traditional interdisciplinarity metrics often rely on predefined, static disciplinary classifications, potentially obscuring complex knowledge integration dynamics. This study introduces a novel framework to quantify knowledge source heterogeneity independent of such boundaries. We employ a GraphSAGE model on a large-scale citation network (1.38 million publications from Microsoft Academic Graph) to learn latent knowledge communities and utilize the Rao-Stirling (RS) Index to measure heterogeneity based on these data-driven communities. Our analysis reveals a complex, non-linear relationship between heterogeneity and scientific impact. While higher heterogeneity generally correlates positively with increased citation counts and ultimate impact, we uncover a U-shaped relationship with disruption, suggesting an optimal level of heterogeneity maximizes transformative potential. Furthermore, highly heterogeneous research, despite often facing delayed recognition, demonstrably achieves greater long-term influence, evidenced by longer impact lifecycles and slower decay rates. These findings underscore the limitations of traditional disciplinary views and highlight the nuanced value of integrating diverse knowledge. By providing a data-driven measure of heterogeneity, this work offers significant implications for research evaluation, funding strategies, and fostering an innovative scientific ecosystem that values long-term impact.
